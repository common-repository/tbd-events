Show your events by date in customisable lists and calendars. Add recurring events, host information - works with Elementor.

== Description ==

TBD Events allows you to sell events - whether they are training sessions, music lessons, seminars or meetups - easily.

You can add all of the information to your product that you normally would, as well as the date(s) of the event, the host (host directory is also included!). Your events can be displayed using one of the two shortcodes in the plugin, either as a list or in a calendar, and can be filtered by category. 

It works natively with WooCommerce and Elementor, and as such the List and Calendar widgets are infinitely customisable.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change a product to an event? =

Simply choose the 'Event' product type on the Product Type dropdown menu.

= How can I change the appearance of the List or Calendar? =

There are some details about the shortcode attributes on the Details page of the plugin.

If you are using Elementor, you can style the widgets as you would any other widget. Otherwise, you can right-click any of the displayed items, then make a CSS style for the classes used.
